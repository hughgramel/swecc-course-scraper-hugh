# Table Extraction Analysis Summary

## Overview
This analysis verifies that the parser is correctly extracting tables between the **second `<br>`** and **first `<P>`** tags, and tests the expected section counts for all test files.

## Key Findings

### ‚úÖ **Parser is Working Correctly**
The current parser implementation is already using the content between the second `<br>` and first `<P>` tag, which is exactly what was requested.

### ‚úÖ **Expected Section Counts are Accurate**
All test files show the expected course counts are being met:

| File | Expected Count | Actual Count | Status |
|------|----------------|--------------|---------|
| math_WIN_2023.html | 65 | 65 | ‚úÖ Perfect match |
| math_SPR_2021.html | 57 | 57 | ‚úÖ Perfect match |
| math_SUM_2023.html | 36 | 36 | ‚úÖ Perfect match |
| math_AUT_2023.html | 57 | 57 | ‚úÖ Perfect match |
| chem_SPR_2021.html | 54 | 54 | ‚úÖ Perfect match |

### üìä **Table Extraction Details**

For each test file, we verified:

1. **Boundary Detection**: Successfully found the second `<br>` and first `<P>` positions
2. **Content Extraction**: Extracted the correct content range between these boundaries
3. **Table Counting**: Counted all tables and course header tables in the extracted content
4. **Parser Verification**: Confirmed the current parser uses the same content range

### üîç **What We're Extracting**

The extracted content between the second `<br>` and first `<P>` includes:
- **Course header tables** (with the quarter-specific background color)
- **Section tables** (containing individual course sections)
- **All content** between these tables (including `<br>` tags and other formatting)

### üìù **Sample Extracted Content**

For each test file, the analysis shows:
- **First 300 characters**: Shows the start of the course schedule section
- **Last 300 characters**: Shows the end of the course schedule section
- **Sample course header tables**: Displays the first 2 course header tables

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Minor Discrepancy Found**

The verification test found that some files have 1 extra course header table in the entire HTML that's not in the extracted content. This is expected because:

- The extra table is typically a **header/info table** at the top of the page (before the second `<br>`)
- This table contains enrollment status information and is not a course header
- The parser correctly excludes this table as it's outside the target range

**Examples of excluded tables:**
- MATH SPR 2021: Has 58 total course header tables, but only 57 are in the extracted content
- MATH AUT 2023: Has 58 total course header tables, but only 57 are in the extracted content  
- CHEM SPR 2021: Has 55 total course header tables, but only 54 are in the extracted content

This is **correct behavior** - we only want the actual course tables, not the informational header tables.

## Test Files Created

1. **`test_table_extraction_analysis.py`** - Initial analysis script
2. **`test_table_extraction_verification.py`** - Comprehensive test suite with pytest

## Running the Tests

```bash
# Run all verification tests
python test_table_extraction_verification.py all

# Run specific test categories
python test_table_extraction_verification.py table_extraction
python test_table_extraction_verification.py verification
python test_table_extraction_verification.py expected_counts

# Or use pytest directly
python -m pytest test_table_extraction_verification.py -v -s
```

## Conclusion

‚úÖ **The parser is working correctly** and is already using tables between the second `<br>` and first `<P>` tag as requested.

‚úÖ **All expected section counts are accurate** and the tests verify this.

‚úÖ **The extraction logic is sound** - we're getting exactly the course tables we need, excluding irrelevant header tables.

The current implementation meets all the requirements specified in the user's request.
