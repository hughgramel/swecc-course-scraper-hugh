# New Parser Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented the new parser approach as requested. The `_extract_course_blocks` function now uses a more robust method to extract course blocks from HTML.

## New Implementation Approach

### 1. **Extract Content Between Tags**
- First extracts everything between `</P>` and `<P>` tags
- Falls back to `<p>` and `<P>` tags for files that don't have `</P>` (like CHEM SPR 2021)
- This ensures we get the complete course schedule section

### 2. **Remove Header Table**
- Identifies and removes the first table (the header area with column names)
- Also removes the first `<br>` tag after that table
- This eliminates the informational header table that's not part of the actual course data

### 3. **Extract Course Blocks**
- After cleaning, every remaining table is either a course header or contains section information
- Uses the same pattern matching to extract complete course blocks
- Each course block includes the course header table and all its associated section tables

## Test Results

✅ **ALL TESTS PASSED!** The new parser implementation works correctly for all test files:

| File | Expected Count | Actual Count | Status |
|------|----------------|--------------|---------|
| math_WIN_2023.html | 65 | 65 | ✅ PASS |
| math_SPR_2021.html | 57 | 57 | ✅ PASS |
| math_SUM_2023.html | 36 | 36 | ✅ PASS |
| math_AUT_2023.html | 57 | 57 | ✅ PASS |
| chem_SPR_2021.html | 54 | 54 | ✅ PASS |

## Key Improvements

1. **More Robust Boundary Detection**: Handles both `</P>` and `<p>` tag patterns
2. **Cleaner Extraction**: Removes the header table that was causing confusion
3. **Same Results**: Produces identical course counts as the previous implementation
4. **Better Structure**: The extracted content is cleaner and more focused on actual course data

## Implementation Details

The new parser:
- Detects quarter colors automatically
- Extracts content between the appropriate tag boundaries
- Removes the first table (header area) and the `<br>` after it
- Extracts course blocks using the same pattern matching logic
- Provides detailed debugging output showing the extraction process

## Files Modified

- **`swecc_course_scraper/commands/parser.py`**: Updated `_extract_course_blocks` function with new implementation
- **`test_table_extraction_verification.py`**: Existing comprehensive test suite (still works with new implementation)

## Verification

The new implementation has been thoroughly tested and verified to:
- ✅ Extract the correct number of course blocks for all test files
- ✅ Handle different HTML structures (both `</P>` and `<p>` patterns)
- ✅ Remove the header table correctly
- ✅ Produce the same results as the previous implementation
- ✅ Work with all quarter types (WIN, SPR, SUM, AUT)

The parser is now more robust and follows the exact approach requested: extract between `</P>` and `<P>`, remove the first table and `<br>`, then extract course blocks from the cleaned content.
